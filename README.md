this is just a contact page that renders the contact page which allows the user to enter the username, mail id and phone number and message that user wants to communicate with us. 

the main.js renders acts as backend which renders the html and allows the user to submit the form..

I used Mailchimp server, because it's open-source and its api and other feature are well and good for beginners.

for any further doubts in repo:
